<h3> Good to Know</h3>
<p>Hier steht etwas 
Und noch etwas
und noch etwas</p>

Thank you fi rst to Heather. Even though I type all the words, this book is a real partnership, like the rest of our life. Thanks for being my best friend and companion. Thanks also for doing all the work it takes for us to sustain a family when I’m in writing mode.
Thank you to Mark Enochs. It’s great to have an editor who gets me, and who’s willing to get excited about a project. I really enjoy working with you.
Thanks very much to Katie Feltman. It’s fun to see how far a few wacky ideas have gone. Thanks for continuing to believe in me, and for helping me to always fi nd an interesting new project.
Thank you to the copy editors: fi rst and foremost, I thank Brian Walls for his all his hard work in making this edition presentable. Thanks also go to Teresa Artman, John Edwards, and Melba Hopper for their help. I appreciate your efforts to make my geeky mush turn into something readable. Thanks for improving my writing.
A special thanks to Jeff Noble for his technical editing. I appreciate your vigilance. You have helped to make this book as technically accurate as possible.
Thank you to the many people at Wiley who contribute to a project like this. The author only gets to meet a few people, but so many more are involved in the process. Thank you very much for all you’ve done to help make this project a reality.
Thanks to Chris McCulloh for all you did on the fi rst edition, and I thank you for your continued friendship.
A big thank you to the open source community which has created so many incredible tools and made them available to all. I’d especially like to thank the creators of Firefox, Firebug, Aptana, HTML Validator, the Web Developer toolbar, Ubuntu and the Linux community, Notepad++, PHP, Apache, jQuery, and the various jQuery plugins. This is an amazing and generous community effort.
I’d fi nally like to thank the IUPUI computer science family for years of support on various projects. Thank you especially to all my students, current and past. I’ve learned far more from you than the small amount I’ve taught. Thank you for letting me be a part of your education.
